      <h2>Game OverView</h2>
    <p>
        Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). The game is played on a rectangular court divided by a net, with players using a stringed racket to hit a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around the net and into the opponent's court.<br>
The objective of tennis is to score points by hitting the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The game can be played on various surfaces such as grass, clay, and hard courts, each adding a unique twist to the gameplay.<br>
Tennis is known for its iconic matches and legendary players who have left a mark on the sport's rich history. Itâ€™s a game of skill, strategy, and endurance that captivates millions of fans worldwide.
